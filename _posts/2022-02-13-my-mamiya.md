A couple of weeks ago I bought an old camera: a Mamiya/Sekor 1000DTL.

A widow messaged my wife on facebook asking if I would be interested in taking a look at photography equipment from her late husband.
She had seen my wife mention my budding interest in film photography on Facebook.

After digging through a dozen or more boxes of old gear and memorabilia, we chatted a bit and I proposed two lots that I was interested in.
First the camera: Mamiya/Sekor 1000DTL along with case, a number of lenses, two speedlights, and some other accessories.

The other lot consisted of darkroom related equipment and supplies. More on that in a later post...

I've hit the camera with some alcohol prep pads since taking the pictures above, it cleaned up pretty well.
The shutter seems to fire reliably and sounds good from 1 - 1/1000.

The light meter appears to be dead, which is a bummer. I reached out to someone who repairs Mamiya cameras; he informed me that he can service it
with all new parts, but it would likely not be economical for me at $175. I'm inclined to agree.
