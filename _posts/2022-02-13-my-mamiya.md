A couple of weeks ago I bought an old camera: a Mamiya/Sekor 1000DTL.

A widow messaged my wife on facebook asking if I would be interested in coming over to look at the photography equipment that belonged to her late husband.
She had seen my wife mention my budding interest in film photography on Facebook. After digging through a dozen or more boxes of old gear and memorabilia
I proposed two lots that I was interested in. First was the camera lot: Mamiya/Sekor 1000DTL along with case, a number of lenses, two speedlights, and some other accessories.

TODO: more pics here

The other lot consisted of darkroom related equipment and supplies. More on that in a later post...
